### Difference between `<div>` `<section>` and `<article>` ### 
	 
`<div>`

1. the generic flow container 

2. It’s a block-level element with no additional semantic meaning 
	
`<section>`

1. a generic document or application section. 
2. A <section> normally has a heading (title) and maybe a footer too. 
3. It’s a chunk of related content, like a subsection of a long article, a major part of the page (eg the news section on the homepage), or a page in a webapp’s tabbed interface. 
	
`<article>`

1. an independent part of a document or site. 

2. This means it should be able to ‘stand alone’, and still make sense if you encountered it somewhere else (e.g. in an RSS feed).

3. Examples include a weblog article (duh), a forum post or a comment. Like <section> these generally have a header, and maybe a footer
