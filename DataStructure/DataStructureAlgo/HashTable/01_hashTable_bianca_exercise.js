  *** Exercises:
  
  1. Implement a hash table with a binary search tree.
  
  2. Given two arrays with values, return the values that are present in both. Do this in linear time.
  
  3. Implement a hash table using linked lists for collision-handling. Why might this be preferable to using arrays.
