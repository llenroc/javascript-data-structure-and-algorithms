1) Technical phone screen - This was a standard collabedit phone screen. 
Part-1 I was given some code and was asked the output and how to
 fix it. It was based on scope and JS inheritance. Part-2 HTML/CSS Had to 
 code it from an image they had. I was also asked to explain floats| promises| accessibility.
 This was pretty straightforward, make sure you brush up on core JS.


2) Heard back roughly a week later and was invited Onsite. 
The onsite had 6 interviews with lunch. The HR will give you the different 
modules each interview focuses on. All interviews we mainly focused on UI(html/css/js) 
except 1 which was an Algo string manipulation question.

Some modules were just JS, some I had to build out the whole component as a plugin(html/css/js). 
The design question was also more UI layer focused than system architecture which was unusual.

3) I left thinking I did well in all my interviews. But unfortunately I didn't get the job, 
the reason I was given was Design and 1 Js round feedback wasn't good. 
In both interviews I kept an open dialog discussed solution , improved with hints and reach a agreeable outcome. 
It was disappointing to not get specific feedback , so I'm not sure what really went wrong.


- String manipulation. Write a jquery method in pure JS. Pragmatic UI.

one was to massage a javascript object to a specific format and 
other was a nested array normalization algo question, for which i used javascript, 
and few questions on javascript (promises, dom etc)

First round was general frontend questions, was asked to created a custom tooltip component, 
like the one in linked in homepage. 
whiteboared everything from markup to css to javascript.


Second round is were I think i messed up. The person interviewing me was a data scientist, 
and this was the first time he was interviewing a frontend person. 
The question took me off guard as it was a basic algo question, 
which I was not prepared for (covert roman numerals to number and vice versa)


Third round was lunch interview. Just talked about my release process and 
asked questions about tech stack in linkedin and other stuff.

Fourth round was a manager, who questioned me about my career goals, my previous accomplishments, 
and asked to code a api server for a small project. And kept making notes and yawing 
all through the talk, which really felt bad.


Fifth round was architecture questions, coded up everything from the datastore level, to apis and UI.

Last round was again with couple of webdevs, but again 2 questions on algorithms. This time coded up without any 
flaw and finished it up so quickly the interviewers were running out of questions to ask.

-(one question on matching braces and one more on object mapping in javascript)


avascript promises, object mapping, build custom tooltip, nested array normalizing with counter 
for each level of nesting, roman numeral to number, build a architecture for a game they had in mind, 
find the missing braces in a string of code.
